# Command line

<p class="lede">One command for each data repository, and one for measured runs before
they are committed. Each validates every document under the path it is given and exits
with a code a CI step can read.</p>

```sh
go run github.com/inference-sim/blis-schemas/cmd/validate-catalog@<version>      <catalog root>
go run github.com/inference-sim/blis-schemas/cmd/validate-registry@<version>     <registry root>
go run github.com/inference-sim/blis-schemas/cmd/validate-measurements@<version> [-local] <measurements dir>
```

Both write every problem to standard error. `validate-catalog` writes to standard output a
heading for each kind of file and one line for each artifact that validates: each file, or
each storage class in `devices/storage.yaml`. `validate-registry` writes one line per set to
standard output, `FAILED` for a set that does not validate. Each ends with a summary line:
`all N ... validate` on standard output, or `N of M ... failed` on standard error.
Warnings are printed and do not fail the run. Both run the field layer only: these
documents name no engine version, so no rules pack applies.

## validate-catalog

| Path | Validated as |
|---|---|
| `models/*/graph.yaml` | a [model graph](model.md), whose `name` must equal the directory. A model directory without one is skipped. |
| `models/*/config.json` | required in every model directory; must be a non-empty JSON object. |
| `models/*/model.yaml` | required in every model directory; a [model identity](model.md#model-identity), whose `name` must equal the directory. |
| `hardware/*.yaml` | a [chip](hardware.md#chip) |
| `networks/*.yaml` | a [fabric](hardware.md#fabric) |
| `devices/storage.yaml` | [storage classes](hardware.md#storage-classes). Optional. |
| `workloads/*.yaml` | a [workload shape](workload.md#shape), or a [replay workload](workload.md#catalog-replay-workload) when its top-level key is `replay:` |
| `measurements/` | as [validate-measurements](#validate-measurements) does, without `-local`. Optional. |

Only files ending in `.yaml` are read in the flat directories. A path is treated as a
catalog if it contains at least one of `models/`, `hardware/`, `networks/`, `workloads/`,
`devices/` and `measurements/`.

## validate-registry

Every file under `coefficients/` whose extension is `.yaml` or `.yml`, in any letter case
and at any depth, is validated as a [coefficient set](coefficients.md). Symbolic links to directories are
not followed. A scenario can refer only to a set at the top level of `coefficients/` with a
`.yaml` extension, by its file name; a set elsewhere validates but cannot be named.

Files under `acceptance/`, found the same way, are validated as
[acceptance-profile sets](acceptance.md#profile-set), each reported as
`acceptance/<file>`. The directory is optional.

## validate-measurements

`sources.yaml` is validated as the [licence registry](measurement.md#licence-registry), and
every `<license_ref>/*.yaml` as a [measured run](measurement.md) against it. A run's `name`
must equal its file name, its `license_ref` its directory, and its stated verdict the
computed one. `duplicate_of` and `supersedes` must name another run in the directory. A YAML
file at the top level other than `sources.yaml` fails. Without `-local`, every run's
licence must permit `redistribute`; with it, scoring alone suffices, for output that stays
out of the repository.

It writes one line per file to standard output, the verdict for a run, and exits `0` when
every file validates, `1` when any fails, and `2` on wrong arguments or a path that is not a
directory.

## Exit codes

| Code | validate-catalog | validate-registry |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | every artifact validated | every set validated |
| `1` | an artifact failed to load or validate | a coefficient or acceptance set failed to load or validate |
| `2` | wrong arguments; the root does not exist; none of the six directories is present; or nothing was found to validate | wrong arguments; the root does not exist; `coefficients/` could not be read; or it holds no coefficient sets |
