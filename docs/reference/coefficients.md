# Coefficient set

<p class="lede">A set of coefficients for a cost model. Each entry records its value and
unit, how it was obtained, the evidence for it, and the hardware and layouts over which it
holds. The registry owns the sets; every consumer loads them through this schema.</p>

The set below is illustrative; its values are not real coefficients. The registry's sets
are in
[`coefficients/`](https://github.com/inference-sim/blis-registry/tree/main/coefficients).

```yaml
--8<-- "docs/examples/coefficient-set.yaml"
```

Each entry in `coefficients` is a map with a single key, the entry's name. A `name` key
inside an entry is accepted and replaced by that map key. A set is
complete in itself: it does not inherit from another set. A scenario may still name several
sets, and how a cost model combines them is described under
[Selecting an entry](#selecting-an-entry).

## Keys

<!-- fields: coefficient.Set -->

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | yes | Always `CoefficientSet`. |
| `name` | string | yes | The set's identity. By convention, not checked, it equals the file name, which is what a scenario's `coefficients` uses. |
| `coefficients` | list | yes | At least one entry, each `- <entry name>: {...}`. |

### Entries

<!-- fields: coefficient.Entry -->

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | number | unless `method` is `not_charged` | The coefficient. Zero exactly when `method` is `not_charged`. |
| `units` | string | yes | One of the [units](vocabularies.md#units). |
| `method` | string | yes | How the value was obtained. One of the [methods](vocabularies.md#methods). |
| `fitted` | boolean | yes | Whether the value comes from fitting a curve. Must be present even when false. |
| `scope` | mapping | yes | Where the value holds, below. At least one dimension. |
| `ci95` | `[low, high]` | no | 95% confidence interval. Must contain `value`. |
| `sources` | list | depends on `method` | Citations, below. If present, not empty. |
| `rationale` | string | depends on `method` | The reasoning behind a value that was not measured. |
| `copied_from` | string | with method `copied` | The scope the value was copied from. |
| `supersedes` | string | no | An entry this one replaces. |
| `validated` | string or list | no | Names of metrics the value has been checked against, such as `itl`. Free text. |
| `unsupported` | string or list | no | Names of metrics it has been found not to hold for. Free text. |

### `scope`

Each dimension lists the values the coefficient holds for. An empty scope is not
"everywhere"; it means the range is unknown, and it is rejected.

<!-- fields: coefficient.Scope -->

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hardware` | list of strings | no | Chips. |
| `model` | list of strings | no | Models. |
| `tp` | list of integers | no | Tensor-parallel widths. |
| `ep` | list of integers | no | Expert-parallel widths. |
| `nodes_spanned` | list of integers | no | How many nodes a collective crosses. |

Dtype and backend are not scope dimensions. Both are part of the entry's name, as in
`gemm_eps_max_bf16`.

### `sources`

<!-- fields: coefficient.Source -->

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kind` | string | yes | One of the [source kinds](vocabularies.md#source-kinds). |
| `cite` | string | yes | The reference: an issue, a paper, a datasheet URL. |
| `role` | string | yes | One of the [source roles](vocabularies.md#source-roles). |

## Identity is name and scope

Two entries may share a name if their scopes differ. The set above has two
`gemm_eps_max_bf16` entries, one for H100 and one for H200. Two entries with the same name
*and* the same scope are an error, because a cost model would use whichever came last.
Scopes are compared without regard to order: `[h100, h200]` and `[h200, h100]` are the same
scope.

## Selecting an entry

The schema defines what an entry says. Choosing among entries is the cost model's job, and
blis-latency-kernel does it as follows. An entry applies to a deployment if, for every
dimension its scope states, the list includes the deployment's value; hardware and model
names are compared without regard to case, and a dimension the scope omits does not
constrain it. The kernel reads the scenario's sets in order and, within each set, its
entries in order, and the last applicable entry for each name is the one it uses. A later
set can therefore override part of an earlier one. Entries that do not apply are skipped.
Construction fails if no entry applies at all, or if the cost model needs a coefficient no
applicable entry supplies.

## What a method requires

| Method | `rationale` | `sources` | Other |
|---|---|---|---|
| `measured` | — | — | The only method that allows `fitted: true`. A source is expected but not required. |
| `literature` | required | at least one | |
| `vendor_spec` | required | at least one | |
| `copied` | required | — | `copied_from` required. |
| `assumed` | required | — | |
| `not_charged` | required | — | `value` must be 0. |

## Checks

A set fails to load if an entry is not a single-key map, an entry has no `fitted` key,
`sources` is present but empty, `ci95` is not a two-element list, `validated` or
`unsupported` is neither a string nor a list of strings, or any mapping has a key its type
does not declare.

A loaded set is invalid if

- `kind` is not `CoefficientSet`, `name` is empty, or there are no entries;
- an entry has no name, or repeats another entry's name and scope;
- `value` is not finite, `units` or `method` is not recognized, or `scope` is empty;
- `value` is 0 with a method other than `not_charged`, or nonzero with `not_charged`;
- `fitted` is true with a method other than `measured`;
- a companion field the method requires, per the table above, is missing;
- a source has an unrecognized `kind` or `role`, or an empty `cite`;
- `ci95` has a non-finite end, has `low` above `high`, or does not contain `value`.
