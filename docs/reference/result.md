# Result

<p class="lede">What one BLIS run predicts: one configuration, at one load, with one seed.
Its metrics are defined in the measured-run vocabulary, so a prediction and a
<a href="measurement.md">measured run</a> of the same configuration compare by metric name
and definition.</p>

`blis run` and `blis replay` write a Result to stdout, JSON by default and YAML on request;
`--output` writes the same bytes. `result.Marshal` writes either encoding with the keys below,
and `LoadResult` (`result.Unmarshal`) reads either, refusing an unknown key: a document whose
first non-blank character is `{` is read as JSON, anything else as YAML. A Result is written
with `result.Marshal`, not `encoding/json`, which reads none of these keys and drops a pool's
engine block. The document embeds the
input it was produced from, resolved, and the revision of everything it read: given that input
at the same revisions, the simulator reproduces the document byte for byte outside `runtime`,
`rerun_of` and `revision_changes`.

## Standard metric names

A Result and a measured run use the same names for the same definitions. A metric outside
this table takes a name of the same form and its own `metric_defs` entry. A Result that uses a
name from this table states the `formula`, `statistic` and `denominator` the table fixes for
it; the validator refuses another.

| Name | Definition |
|---|---|
| `output_tok_s` | Output tokens over the measured window (`output_throughput`, `denominator: profiling_window`). |
| `output_tok_s_per_gpu` | `output_tok_s` over the GPUs the deployment's pools use (`denominator: per_gpu`). |
| `interactivity_mean` | Mean over requests of (output tokens − 1) / (E2E − TTFT), tokens/s/user (`user_tps`). |
| `interactivity_p50`, `interactivity_p90` | 1000 over the p50 and p90 of per-request ITL (`interactivity`). |
| `ttft_mean_ms`, `ttft_p50_ms`, `ttft_p90_ms`, `ttft_p99_ms` | Time to first token (`ttft`), statistic as named. |
| `itl_mean_ms`, `itl_p50_ms`, `itl_p90_ms`, `itl_p99_ms` | Per-request inter-token latency per token (`tpot_excl_first`). Never the per-decode-step interval. |

## `rerun_of` and `revision_changes`

A Result produced from another Result's input names it, and lists every component whose
revision differs. Both are absent on a fresh run.

<!-- fields: result.Reference -->

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |

| `name` | string | yes | The other Result's `name`. |
| `sha256` | string | yes | The other Result document's digest. |

| `requests` | integer | yes | Requests completed inside it; at most `requests.completed`. |

## `requests`

Every injected request ends in exactly one terminal bucket: `injected` equals the sum of
`completed` through `encode_routing_rejections`, and `generated` equals `injected` plus
`rejected`.

<!-- fields: result.Requests -->

<!-- fields: result.ClassGoodput -->

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `completed` | integer | yes | Completed requests of the class. |
| `met` | integer | yes | Those that met the class's targets; at most `completed`. |

## `breakdowns`

Each slice maps a metric name, a lowercase slug, to a finite value that is not negative.
`per_model`, `per_tenant` and `per_adapter` split the Result's own metrics, so each of their
names has a `metric_defs` entry and its value is in that entry's units. `pd` and `sessions`
also carry quantities with no measurement formula (a KV-transfer time, turns per session),
named in the same `<quantity>_<statistic>_<unit>` form.

|---|---|---|---|
| `pd` | mapping | no | The prefill/decode split of a disaggregated run. |
| `per_model` | mapping | no | By model. |

| `sha256` | string | yes | The file's digest. |
| `rows` | integer | no | Row count, for a table. |

## `runtime`

Determinism and round-trip comparisons skip this block, and nothing else.

## Validation

`Validate(Bundle{Result: r})` checks the Result field by field, the input it embeds included.
Engine rules do not run on that embedded input: pass `&r.Input.Scenario` and
`&r.Input.Deployment` as the bundle's `Scenario` and `Deployment` to rule-check it. With
`Rules` set, a Result and no `Scenario`, the rule layer warns (`result-input-rules`).

<!-- fields: result.Runtime -->

| Key | Type | Required | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `wall_clock_s` | number | no | Wall-clock seconds the run took. |
| `started_utc` | string | no | When it started, RFC 3339 in UTC, ending `Z`. |
| `host` | mapping | no | Host facts, for example `os` and `arch`. |
