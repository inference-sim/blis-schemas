// Spec is how a simulator hands an engine its configuration without reading it: the
// engine's kind, the upstream release it models, and the configuration block itself,
// kept as YAML only the engine decodes.
//
// The kind is what keeps engine identity out of the simulator. A simulator looks the kind
// up in the factory registry and passes the rest through; a second engine registers
// another kind and needs no change here or in the simulator.

	// UpstreamVersion is the release of the real engine the configuration was written
	// for, such as "0.32.0". An engine refuses a release it does not model rather than
	// running it as another; the version is a check, not a selector.
	UpstreamVersion string
	// Config is the engine's configuration block, exactly as the document gave it. A
	// factory decodes the node itself (Node.Decode) rather than a re-encoding of it, so the
	// node's positions put a configuration error at its line in the document.

	// Roots are the directories the engine may read further inputs from, by role: a
	// model catalog, a coefficient registry, the directory of the file the
	// configuration came from. A simulator passes the paths; the engine opens them.

	// pool of a disaggregated deployment. Each pool is one engine.
