// EngineRules is everything a consumer asks of one engine release's rules: which values it
// accepts, how it resolves what a deployment leaves unstated, and its version-scoped checks.
// The rules live with the engine model that owns the release, and a cost model or a
// validator takes them from its caller (Bundle.Rules): this schema registers none of its own.
//
// A consumer that needs a fact the interface does not name asks for a method to be added
// here, rather than type-asserting to a particular implementation: an assertion silently
// skips the fact for any other.
