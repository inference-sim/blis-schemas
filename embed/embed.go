// Package embed is the contract between a simulator that hosts a request router and the
// router it hosts, the counterpart of package kernel: kernel is how a simulator prices work,
// embed is how it lets a real router decide where that work goes.
//
// The boundary is ownership. The host owns simulated time, background work and randomness
// (it implements Runtime), the endpoints' lifecycle (it calls SetEndpoint and
// RemoveEndpoint), and what each engine publishes (it serves the router's outbound HTTP
// through RoundTripper and feeds KV events through IngestKVEvents). The router owns every
// routing decision and the meaning of its configuration. The contract never restates router
// configuration — scorers, weights, profiles — which travels as the deployment's own bytes
// (Config); what a host needs to know about it comes back as facts (Requirements), and the
// host decides what those facts mean for the engines it simulates.
//
// # Determinism
//
// A router is a deterministic function of its Config, the Runtime it runs on and the
// sequence of calls the host makes. It reads time only through Runtime.Now and the timers and
// tickers Runtime makes, starts concurrent work only through Runtime.Go and Runtime.Every,
// blocks only through Runtime.Park, draws randomness only from Runtime.Rand, and reaches the
// network only through the Runtime's RoundTripper. On a deterministic Runtime it makes the
// same decisions every time.
//
// # Calls
//
// The host calls Router and Flight methods from one goroutine at a time, never concurrently,
// and never from inside a callback the router is running. The router calls back into the host
// only through Runtime and through Route's done (see Route).
//
// # Compatibility
//
// Interfaces here are implemented in other repositories, so within a major version none of
// them gains a method; an optional capability is a separate interface (RoundTripper), found by
// type assertion. Struct types may gain fields in a minor version, with the zero value meaning
// what the type meant before the field existed; construct them with keyed literals. A new
// RejectKind or Termination value is a minor change too: a host maps a kind it does not know
// as it maps Unclassified.
//
// Package embedtest checks a Constructor against this contract.
