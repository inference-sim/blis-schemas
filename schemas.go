// Package blisschemas is the entry point: it composes field-level validation with
// version-scoped rule validation over a complete set of documents.
//
// The two layers stay visible in the result. A Report separates field problems from
// rule problems, because the two need different responses: a field problem is a
// malformed document and always the author's to fix, where a rule problem may mean
// the document is right and the engine version is wrong, or that a rule needs
// updating for a release it has not seen.
//
// Field validation runs first and rule validation only if it passes. A rule reading
// a malformed document produces findings that are artifacts of the malformation, and
// a reader cannot tell those from real ones.
