// Package scenario describes the immutable problem a user is handed: which model, on
// which available hardware, measured against which workload (a distributional shape or a
// concrete captured trace), and fitted against which coefficient and engine-version
// references.
//
// A scenario is a file rather than a flag list so that an estimate is reproducible
// from committed artifacts. It names catalog and registry entries by identity. What it
// deliberately does NOT carry is the tunable configuration an optimizer sweeps —
// parallelism, how many prefill vs decode pods, engine knobs, offload layout, PD
// transfer; those are a separate Deployment (spec/deployment). The split keeps the
// immutable problem apart from the mutable choices made against it: one `blis run` is
// one Scenario and one Deployment, and the operating point (load level) is a run-level
// sweep axis that is neither.
