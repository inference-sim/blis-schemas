// validateRankFit refuses an engine that needs more GPUs than it has been given. Every
// rank is one device — the engine's worker binds cuda:local_rank — so a layout's
// footprint is its rank count; nothing in the divisibility or node-sum checks relates the
// two, which is how tp 8 with pcp 4 on a single 8-GPU node validated while needing 32.
//
// Two bounds, each refusing only what no launch can run.
//
// The engine against its pool: pp x tp x pcp x dp ranks must not exceed the GPUs in the
// pool's nodes. This is the engine's own world_size_across_dp. DCP and expert parallelism
// add no ranks — DCP reuses the tensor-parallel ranks, and an expert group is built over
// ranks that already exist — so neither enters the product. It is an upper bound because
// a pool may hold several engines: llm-d runs a LeaderWorkerSet of `replicas` groups, each
// one engine over `size` nodes, so a 36-node pool of dp 8 is 36 engines of one node each.
//
// The local replicas against one node, when dp_local is stated. The engine places local
// data-parallel replica i at devices [i x world, i x world + local_world), where world is
// pp x tp x pcp and local_world is the share of one replica on one node
// (get_physical_gpu_ids_for_local_dp_rank). That share depends on the engine's node
// count n, which the schema does not carry and the launch chooses:
//
//   - n is 1 for each process llm-d starts — one vLLM per pod, joined by
//     --data-parallel-start-rank — so local_world is the whole replica.
//   - For n above 1, the engine splits each replica over n / (dp / dp_local) nodes
//     (nnodes_within_dp); that must divide world, which the multiprocessing executor
//     asserts, and local_world is world divided by it.
//
// So the bound asserted is: some n from 1 to the pool's node count gives a split under
// which every local replica's devices lie on the node. That refuses exactly what no
// launch can place — including a split that would need more nodes than the pool owns —
// and nothing the engine runs. It is the same at v0.29.0, which rounds n / (dp /
// dp_local) down, and later releases, which require it to divide: rounding n down to a
// multiple gives the same split, so the set of placeable layouts is identical.
//
// When dp_local is unset the engine infers it from the launch, so no per-node verdict is
// possible and none is given.
//
// A width the checks above already reported as malformed describes no layout, so each
// bound declines to run over it rather than invent a count and file a second problem
// naming the wrong field. That matters for more than tidiness: two negative widths
// multiply to a large positive one. An unset pcp is the one zero that is meaningful — it
// means off, and counts as one. A cluster or pool that states no room constrains nothing,
// the way an undeclared storage inventory does. The per-node bound also declines when
// the pool bound has already refused the layout: an engine that does not fit at all does
// not need a second explanation of why it does not fit on a node.
//
// Counts are exact (math/big) rather than int: a width absurd enough to overflow must still
// compare correctly against a pool that is also absurdly large, and a message must never
// print a clamped number as though it were the real one.
