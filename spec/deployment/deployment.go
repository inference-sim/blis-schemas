// Package deployment describes the mutable configuration a user — or an optimizer
// sweeping a configuration space — chooses against a fixed Scenario: how a model is
// laid out across the available hardware (pools, each a role at a parallelism layout
// with its own engine settings), the KV offload hierarchy below HBM, and
// prefill-to-decode KV transfer.
//
// It is the tunable half of what a single `blis run` consumes. The immutable problem
// — the model, the workload (a distributional shape or a concrete trace reference), the
// available-hardware inventory, and the coefficient/engine-version references that
// identify what a prediction is fitted against — lives in a Scenario. A Scenario and a
// Deployment together describe one run; the operating point (load level) is a run-level
// sweep axis that is neither.
//
// Three rules shape the schema, each preventing a class of error rather than
// catching it later:
//
// Derived quantities have no field. Expert-parallel width is the product of the
// tensor-, prefill-context- and data-parallel widths, because that is the group the
// engine builds. A deployment that could state EP independently could describe a
// layout no engine would run, so the field does not exist.
//
// Requested settings are distinct from resolved ones. A collective backend and an
// async-scheduling preference are requests: crossing a node boundary without
// multi-node NVLink disqualifies an SM-consuming all-reduce kernel whatever the
// field says, and async scheduling has several disqualifying conditions. The
// resolver reports what it resolved, so a reader is never misled by a request.
//
// Engine settings are per pool. A prefill/decode-disaggregated deployment runs two
// kinds of engine with different backends and different graph modes; one shared
// engine block would describe neither.
