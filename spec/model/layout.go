// TPLayout is how one node's work and weights divide across tensor-parallel ranks.
//
// A consumer without it has to guess, and the guess is wrong exactly where it matters.
// blis-latency-kernel infers a GEMM's split from whether k equals the hidden size and
// divides every other node by tp. DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on vLLM v0.31.0 runs a large share
// of each layer replicated on every rank: the fused q/kv A-projection
// (MergedColumnParallelLinear with disable_tp=True, "fused ReplicatedLinear"), the
// compressor, the indexer's projections ("no tensor parallel, just replicated"), the
// router gate (GateLinear, a ReplicatedLinear), and all of mHC, whose FP32 parameters are
// plain tensors with no split. Dividing those by tp prices one tp-th of the work.
//
// Absent means the consumer's inference, so a graph opts in per node.
