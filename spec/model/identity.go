// Identity is a catalog model entry's identity manifest: the file blis-catalog commits
// as models/<name>/model.yaml, beside the verbatim vendor config.json and the derived
// graph.yaml. It is a different artifact from the cost Graph this package otherwise
// describes — it prices nothing — so it carries no shape, only the name the entry claims
// and the provenance of the vendor file it was built from.
//
// Unlike a chip, a fabric or a workload, this file states its name IN the document rather
// than taking it from the filename: the catalog requires that stated name to match the
// directory it sits in, and the validate-catalog command checks that, as it does for a
// graph. Validate here checks only what the document can know about itself.
//
// The checks mirror the MODEL.YAML portion of blis-catalog's own validate_models: name must
// be a non-empty string (its match against the directory is the caller's check), and source
// must be present with a non-empty provider, repo and revision. validate_models applies no
// further restriction to those fields — no pattern on provider (any non-empty string,
// "huggingface" in practice) and no date-format check on retrieved — so retrieved is declared
// here only to name the key every real card carries, and is neither required nor
// format-checked. The catalog's gate also checks the sibling config.json (present, parseable,
// a non-empty object), and that is deliberately NOT mirrored here: config.json is a verbatim
// vendor file the catalog owns, and these schemas do not read it (#23). So this is the
// model.yaml half of a two-gate split, not a reimplementation of the whole catalog gate.
//
// Field values aside, the loader (LoadModelIdentity) decodes strict: an unknown key is
// rejected, where the catalog's Python gate reads model.yaml leniently and ignores extra
// keys. That is intentional and NOT a claim of leniency-parity — an unknown key is a probable
// typo that would otherwise silently drop the setting its author meant, and rejecting it is
// the same filename-identity direction #27/#25 take. One consequence: unlike Chip and Fabric,
// Identity does not strip the catalog's underscore-prefixed _comment* keys (the same gap #28
// tracks for workload Shape), so such a key would be rejected rather than ignored; no
// committed model.yaml carries one today.

	Name   string  `yaml:"name"`

// Source records where a model entry's vendor config was retrieved from, so a derived

	// Repo is the provider-scoped repository path, e.g. "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro".
	Repo string `yaml:"repo"`
	// Revision pins the exact commit the config was taken at. A branch name would let the
	// upstream move under a fixed graph, which is the drift the digest in the graph's
	// derived_from exists to catch; this pins the other end of that comparison.
	Revision string `yaml:"revision"`
	// Retrieved is the date the config was fetched, as provenance. Optional: it is not
	// part of the identity the catalog's gate enforces, so it is recorded where present
	// and never required.

// Validate performs field-level validation of a model identity manifest: a name must be
