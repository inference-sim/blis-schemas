// Package hardware defines the three catalog entities that describe physical
// resources: a chip, an inter-node fabric, and a storage device class.
//
// They are three schemas rather than one because they have different owners and
// different lifetimes. A chip's peak rates are a datasheet fact about a die. A
// fabric is a property of the cluster a deployment runs on — blis-catalog states
// this directly, "a fabric is a property of the cluster/pool, not of the GPU die" —
// so the same chip appears behind InfiniBand in one cluster and RoCE in another.
// Storage tiers are a third thing again, owned by whoever provisioned the node.
//
// The separation matters to the cost model. Cross-node collective cost
// turns on the ratio of intra-node to inter-node bandwidth, and that ratio is a
// property of a (chip, fabric) pairing rather than of either alone. A schema that
// put both numbers on the chip would make the ratio look like a die fact and would
// force a new hardware file for every fabric a chip is ever paired with.

// The catalog's files carry free-text keys prefixed with "_comment" — _comment,
// _comment_interconnect, _comment_sm, _comment_pd_transfer — holding the provenance
// narrative for each number.
// They are deliberate content rather than stray fields, so a strict decoder must accept
// them while still rejecting a misspelled real field.
//
// The prefix is "_comment" specifically, not any underscore: hardware/ carries only
// dimensioned physical quantities, and a fitted or dimensionless factor must not enter —
// not even disguised under an underscore. A "_mfu: 0.85" is therefore an unknown field,
// not a comment, and fails like any other, matching the rule blis-catalog's deleted
// validate_catalog.py enforced.
//
// A consequence worth stating: these comment keys are STRIPPED here, before decoding, so
// no provenance prose survives onto the struct. The deleted gate's SM-count citation rule
// (#32, item 4) — every SMCount must carry a chaseable source URL — therefore cannot live
// in Chip.Validate(), which never sees the prose. That rule is a catalog-provenance policy
// (does the prose cite a source), not a schema-structural invariant (is the value a sane
// datasheet figure), so it belongs in a catalog-side lint over the raw files rather than
// here. It is deliberately NOT enforced by this package and nowhere else today; issue #32
// is the tracked home for the decision on where that lint lives, and stays open until it
// exists. This is the explicit tracking #32 asks for in lieu of a silent drop.
//
// The files also carry no name: identity is the filename. Chip.Name and Fabric.Name are
// tagged `yaml:"-"`, so yaml.v3 binds no `name` key to them and the strict decoder rejects
// a stray one — an in-file name cannot become a second source of truth for an identity the
// filename already fixes. A loader sets Name from the path stem (its only source), and
// validation requires it, so a chip that reaches a cost model without one is an error
// rather than an anonymous descriptor.
