// Package connector describes the KV-connector registry: which engine connector names a
// deployment may use, which engine interface each implements, and which engine model in
// an engine module reproduces its behaviour.
//
// A connector name in a deployment (offload.connector, pd_transfer.connector) is looked up
// here instead of in a list compiled into a simulator, so a new connector that behaves like
// an existing one is data, not code. The rule that keeps the registry honest
// (inference-sim/inference-sim#2021 B10): implementing an engine's connector interface is not
// the same as behaving like one of its connectors. An entry names the model it behaves like
// and the evidence that earned it, which for a built-in connector is a differential test
// against the engine release. A connector with no such evidence is not registered.
//
// This package holds the shape only. The entries live with the engine model that owns the
// behaviour (the engine module that owns the engine model).
