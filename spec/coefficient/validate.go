// Validate performs field-level validation of a coefficient set: the vocabulary
// terms are recognized, the required fields are present, and the evidence fields
// are internally consistent.
//
// What it does not do is judge whether a value is right, or whether a set is the
// right one for a given cost model. The first needs a measurement; the second is a
// scenario-level question.

	// A set covering several parts carries one entry per (name, scope): the GEMM
	// efficiency asymptote is a different number on H100 than on H200, and both are
	// called gemm_eps_max_bf16 because a resolver selects between them by scope.
	// Keying on the name alone would forbid that shape, and pushing the part into the
	// name instead would duplicate in the name what the scope already states —
	// leaving a resolver no way to tell that two entries are the same quantity
	// measured on different hardware.
	//
	// Two entries sharing a name AND a scope are still an error: a resolver would
	// keep whichever came last, so the file would mean something other than it says.

	// gemm_eps_max_bf16 at both {hardware: h100} and {hardware: h200}. The (name, scope)
	// rule is the more expressive one and is authoritative once the registry adopts this
	// validator as its single gate (blis-registry#29); until then a set this accepts could
	// be rejected by the registry's Python gate, so the loosening is a contract change, not
	// a like-for-like migration.
