// walk taking both .yaml and .yml, case-insensitively, de-duplicated by resolved path,
// in deterministic sorted order. Sharing that predicate is the point — a set the
// registry's Python gate sees is one a Go consumer sees too, so a .yml set, an upper-case
// extension, or a set in a subdirectory cannot pass one gate while the other never looks
// at it. A set the gate does not see is worse than one it rejects.
//
// Like any plain directory walk it does not descend into symlinked directories, so a set
// reachable only through a linked directory is out of scope; the registry stores its sets
// as regular files. The result is empty with no error when the directory is absent, so a
// caller can treat "no sets" as its own case rather than an error.
